<h2>Posts and Categories</h2>
<p>
  <i>Posts</i> are short for 'blog posts'. Posts are displayed on the front end under the <code>/blog</code>
  path and are based on the original KeystoneJS Post Model. <i>Categories</i> are used
  to organize blog posts, but their usage is optional. The Post/Category scheme is borrowed
  from the user interface used by WordPress.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Posts</i> area of the ConnextCMS Dashboard contains three Backbone Views:
  Categories, All Posts, and Add New.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Categories View</i> is where you add or delete categories to organize blog posts. Each
  category can be assigned a 'priority', which determines the order in which it is displayed
  in the Add New View.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>All Posts View</i> displays a table listing all the blog posts that have been created.
  The first column displays the title of the post. Clicking on this title will open the post
  for editing in the Add New View. The last person to edit the post is displayed in the second column.
  The category assigned to the post is displayed in the third column, and the date the post
  was published is displayed in the fourth column.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Add New View</i> is slightly mis-named. While it is used to add new posts, it is also
  used to edit existing posts. Each blog post consists of a title, a published state, a publish
  date, category, hero image (optional), and content. The content is edited in a 
  <a href="https://www.tinymce.com/" target="_blank">TinyMCE WYSWYG editor</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  Setting the Publish State of a post to <i>Draft</i> or <i>Archive</i> will remove it from the
  front end (publically viewable) area of your website. The Hero Image is simply the primary image
  associated with the post. It is not displayed automatically, but can be retrieved on the front
  end using JavaScript to make an AJAX call to the <code>/api/posts/list</code> API.
