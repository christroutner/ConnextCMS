<h2>Front End Widgets</h2>
<p>
  Front End Widgets are useful for allowing users to change content on the site while maintaining
  tight control over the visual layout. Content stored in Front End Widgets can be retrieved on
  the front end using JavaScript to make an AJAX call to the <code>/api/frontendwidget/list</code>
  API.
</p>
<p>
  Clicking the 'Front End Widgets' entry in the left menu will bring up the <i>Front End Widget View</i>,
  which will load all widgets in a table. Clicking the '+Add Widget' button will add a new row to the table.
  Clicking on the title of any widget will open it in the widget editor.
</p>
<p>
  Every widget is made of the following elements: A title, a description, an array of HTML content,
  an array of image URLs, and an array of generic URLs. The title and description are primarily used
  for organizing widgets within the ConnextCMS Dashboard. HTML content and generic URLs can be added
  or removed from their arrays by clicking the plus and minus buttons on the left and right of their
  areas. 
  HTML content is edited using the TinyMCE WYSWYG editor.
  Image URLs can be added to the array by clicking on the image or removed by clicking the
  red 'x' button above the image. For more than three images, click the '+Add Image Row' button
  to expand the user interface.
</p>
<p>
  When developing front end content, Front End Widgets can be retrieved using the <code>/api/frontendwidget/list</code>
  API. The <i>content</i> stored in the widgets arrays can be accessed and applied to the front end on-the-fly
  while maintaining the integrity of the visual <i>layout</i>. This is in contrast to Pages or Posts, which
  allow the user to edit both the <i>content</i> and <i>layout</i>.
