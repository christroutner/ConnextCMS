<h2>Pages, Section, and Navigation Menu</h2>
<p>
  The Page/Section scheme is very similar to the Post/Category scheme. 
  Pages are organized into Sections, just as Posts are organized into Categories.
  ConnextCMS Pages are also similar to the concept of Pages as used in WordPress. 
</p>
<p>
  Unlike Catgories though, Sections directly affect the navigation menu on the front
  end of the website by creating a new drop-down menu item. Pages within that Section
  can be accessed through this drop-down menu item. This default behavior is controlled
  by the file <code>/public/js/navMenu.js</code> and can be changed by modifying that file.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Page</i> area of the ConnextCMS Dashboard contains three Backbone Views:
  Sections, All Pages, and Add New. The behavior of these three views is very similar to
  the three Views used in the Post area.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Section View</i> is where you add or delete sections to organize pages and generate
  a navigation menu for the site. Each
  section can be assigned a 'priority', which determines the order in which it is displayed
  in the navigation menu. Setting a priority to zero will prevent that section (and all pages
  assigned to it) from being displayed in the navigation menu.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>All Pages View</i> displays a table listing all the pages that have been created.
  The first column displays the title of the page. Clicking on this title will open the page
  for editing in the Add New View. The last editor of the page is displayed in the second column.
  The section assigned to the page is displayed in the third column, and the date the page
  was published is displayed in the fourth column.
</p>
<p>
  Like in Posts, the <i>Add New View</i> for Pages is used to add new pages and to edit 
  existing pages. Each page consists of a title, a published state, a publish
  date, section, priority, content, and (optional) redirect. The content is edited in a 
  <a href="https://www.tinymce.com/" target="_blank">TinyMCE WYSWYG editor</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  The priority of a page determines the order it is displayed in the drop-down of the navigation menu.
  Setting a priority to zero will prevent that page from being displayed in the navigation menu, but
  the page can still be accessed through a direct URL. Similarly, setting the Publish State of a 
  page to <i>Draft</i> or <i>Archive</i> will remove it from the front end (publically viewable) 
  area of the website.
</p>
<p>
  The Redirect input box allows assignment of a redirect URL to the page. This is handy for creating
  navigation menu items that redirect to other URLs. Leaving the <i>Open in New Window</i>
  checkbox unchecked will open the redirect in the current window. Checking the box will open the
  redirect in a new window.
</p>

<h4>Private Pages</h4>
<p>
  As described in the <a href="/documentation/configuration.html#privatePages">Private Pages</a>
  documentation, one of the Page Sections can be assigned to be accessible only to logged-in users.
  This section will show up as a navigation menu item like all other sections, but will only be
  displayed to logged-in users.
