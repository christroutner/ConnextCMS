<h2>Image and File Library</h2>
<p>
  One of the core features of ConnextCMS is local image and file hosting. Images uploaded
  to the library automatically get resized copies made in widths of 300px, 600px, and 1200px, where applicable.
  TinyMCE plugins have been developed to link to images and files in the library when editing content
  on the site.
</p>
<p>
  The Image Library consists of two Backbone Views: Image Library, and Add New Image. The File
  Library consists of one Backbone View: File Library.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Image Library View</i> displays all the images that have been added to the library.
  Clicking on an image in the library will bring up the Image Update interface. This
  interface provides links to the original image as well as all the resized copies of the image.
  It's also possible to edit the HTML Title and Alt Text associated with this image.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Add New Image View</i> allows users to upload new images to the image
  library.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>File Library View</i> allows viewing and uploading to
  the file library. Upload buttons are at the top of this View and the library is
  displayed below in a table. Clicking on the title of a file initiates the download of that file.
  A delete button exists to the right of each file listed in the table, which allows users
  to delete files from the system.

  Below is a screenshot of the TinyMCE WYSWYG editor that is used to edit content on the site. 
  The image below shows the location of the buttons for inserting
  images and links to files within the editor.
