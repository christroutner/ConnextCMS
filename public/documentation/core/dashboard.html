<h2>The Dashboard</h2>
<p>
  The ConnextCMS dashboard is accessed through the <code>/dashboard</code> path. If you are not
  logged in to the system, you will be redirected to a login page before being allowed to
  access that page. <code>/dashboard</code> is the only KeystoneJS View used by ConnextCMS
  <i>core</i>. The layout of the ConnextCMS dashboard is based on the 
  <a href="https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE" target="_blank">AdminLTE template</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The first Backbone View that will appear under the <code>/dashboard</code> path is the
  <i>Dashboard View</i>. The content of this View is copied from the AdminLTE template. This
  view is intended to be customized in each installation, and it shows off some of the front end features
  you may want to incorporate into your own dashboard view. This includes graphs, alerts and notifications,
  as well as an example button that launches the a modal using the ConnextCMS <a href="/documentation/basics.html#modalView">Modal View</a>.
